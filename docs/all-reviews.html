          Show stopping quality and dedication to perfection.

          I worked with Ray over a few months for my engagement ring.   
          I vetted over 8 different jewelers across the nation and I am so happy
          to have chosen Ray with Thee Raymond Lee. I brought a very detailed and unique ring design.
          Ray offered great pointers and recommendations but at the end of the day respected
          my drive to want to see my vision through and even gave me more freedom by assuring
          that we always had options should I need to make changes.
          I am so happy with the end result and I cannot wait to be able to post a pic of the ring,
          but in the meantime I can strongly recommend Thee Raymond Lee. 
          My ring arrived today and I am in awe.

          We heard of T.R.L. from a friend. Setting an appointment was a breeze; their website
          was very easy to navigate, and when we met Raymond, we were met with enthusiasm, care,
          and the beautiful Mexican culture. Raymond went above and beyond each appointment. 
          He worked with our budget and gave us the opportunity to create our dream engagement ring.
          We know our ring was made with care and love. We are beyond thankful T.R.L. was a part
          of this big moment for us.

        <blockquote>
          Thee Raymond Lee team is absolutely wonderful! I’ve been working with them for the last 5 years
          on designing my current wedding bands. For my 5 year anniversary I wanted the exact same
          wedding band that my husband gave me on our wedding day so I can stack them up against
          each other. Thee Raymond Lee did such an amazing job when I got the band it was so difficult
          for me to tell my original from my new wedding band that I had to get the number “5”
          laser engraved so I knew the difference. Fast forward another 5 years, I got another
          wedding band because I love the set so much! And this one I had them laser engrave “10”
          so I knew which was which. Everything from the quality to the customer service matched
          on both of my experiences. Definitely recommend these guys for any custom work, or
          just to bring your vision to life.

          I have worked with Ray and the Thee Raymond Lee team for several years now
          and without question are my go-to jewelers in the city! I not only bought my wife's
          custom engagement ring and our wedding bands with the team but went back after a few
          years to upgrade her engagement ring as well.

          Ray is an absolute professional and treats his customers with respect
          and is truly genuine in his interactions and wanting only the best for his clients.

          In all categories, Thee Raymond Lee delivers:
          - Customer Engagement
          - Sales Cycle
          - Post Sales
          - Customer Service
          - Attention to Detail
          - Value
          - Quality
          - The list goes on and on…

        <blockquote>
          My fiancé worked with Ray on picking out my engagement ring. It is absolutely perfect
          and they have been so great to work with. Ray helped my fiancé’s vision for the ring
          come to life and walked him through every step of the way while going through the
          diamond selection process. Since I have had the ring, their customer service has been over the top.
          They make you feel so comfortable, like you are dealing with friends you've had for a long time.
          I recommend Thee Raymond Lee to anyone who needs fine jewelry!

          I have been going to Thee Raymond Lee since they opened and I have had nothing but GREAT service.
          From family heirlooms to birthday presents, they can handle all of your jewelry needs
          in a professional and thoughtful way. Their creative minds get you to think outside of the normal
          while maintaining a classic look and feel with all of their pieces.
          If I need anything remotely related to jewelry, there’s no other place that I would go.
          Thee Raymond Lee is highly recommended.
