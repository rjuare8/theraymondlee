            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Raymond L. Costello Jr grew up on the south side of Chicago in the vibrant neighborhood of Pilsen, where the hustle and creativity are as real as the deep-dish pizza debates. He fell into the jewelry world in April 2011 and hasn’t looked back since, proudly “Putting Rings on Tings" for over a decade. After five years of working for someone else, he decided to take a shot at going solo, opening his first store in 2016 and his second company not too long afterwards in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a first-generation business owner in a field often run by multi-generational families, Raymond Lee carved out his niche in engagement rings and bridal jewelry while mastering the art of creating timeless pieces For Everyone / Everywhere. He’s proof that you don’t need a family legacy to create magic—you just need a vision, a good sense of humor, and maybe a little coffee. His laid-back, one-on-one approach has made him the go-to jeweler for clients who want more than just sparkle—they want a story.
